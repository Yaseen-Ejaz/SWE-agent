In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\\n\\n  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]\\n\\n  arguments:\\n    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run.

The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\\n    - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start.

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\\n\",\"extra_fields\":{},\"type\":\"text\",\"id\":\"django__django-10914\"},\"output_dir\":\"DEFAULT\",\"actions\":{\"open_pr\":false,\"pr_config\":{\"skip_if_commits_reference_issue\":true},\"apply_patch_locally\":false},\"env_var_path\":null}",
