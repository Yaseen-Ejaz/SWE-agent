[Bug]: NumPy 1.24 deprecation warnings
### Bug summary

Starting NumPy 1.24 I observe several deprecation warnings.


### Code for reproduction

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

plt.get_cmap()(np.empty((0, ), dtype=np.uint8))
```


### Actual outcome

```
/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/matplotlib/colors.py:730: DeprecationWarning: NumPy will stop allowing conversion of out-of-bound Python integers to integer arrays.  The conversion of 257 to uint8 will fail in the future.
For the old behavior, usually:
    np.array(value).astype(dtype)`
will give the desired result (the cast overflows).
  xa[xa > self.N - 1] = self._i_over
/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/matplotlib/colors.py:731: DeprecationWarning: NumPy will stop allowing conversion of out-of-bound Python integers to integer arrays.  The conversion of 256 to uint8 will fail in the future.
For the old behavior, usually:
    np.array(value).astype(dtype)`
will give the desired result (the cast overflows).
  xa[xa < 0] = self._i_under
/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/matplotlib/colors.py:732: DeprecationWarning: NumPy will stop allowing conversion of out-of-bound Python integers to integer arrays.  The conversion of 258 to uint8 will fail in the future.
For the old behavior, usually:
    np.array(value).astype(dtype)`
will give the desired result (the cast overflows).
  xa[mask_bad] = self._i_bad
```

### Expected outcome

No warnings.

### Additional information

_No response_

### Operating system

ArchLinux

### Matplotlib Version

3.6.2

### Matplotlib Backend

QtAgg

### Python version

Python 3.10.9

### Jupyter version

_No response_

### Installation

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

DISCUSSION
To resolve the NumPy deprecation warning when using an empty array with dtype=np.uint8 in matplotlib's colorbar functions, we can modify how the empty array is created. Instead of directly creating a uint8 array, which triggers deprecated behavior checks, create an empty integer (int64) array and then cast it to uint8.

This approach avoids triggering the deprecated conversion warnings by ensuring that NumPy doesn't perform unnecessary checks on an empty array. The cast from int64 to uint8 is safe since all elements (none in this case) are valid integers within the range of uint8.

By making this change, the deprecation warnings should no longer appear when running the code with NumPy 1.24 or higher.

To resolve the NumPy deprecation warnings when creating an empty array with `dtype=np.uint8`, we can modify how the empty array is initialized. Instead of directly specifying `np.uint8`, create an integer (int64) array and then cast it to `uint8`. This approach avoids triggering the deprecated conversion checks since there are no elements to validate.

Here's the modified code:

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Identify the Issue**: The deprecation warnings occur because NumPy checks if elements in an array are within valid bounds for a specified dtype, even when the array is empty.

2. **Modify Array Initialization**: Instead of creating an empty array with `dtype=np.uint8`, first create an empty integer (int64) array and then cast it to `uint8`. This avoids triggering the deprecation warnings since there are no elements to check for overflow.

3. **Update Code**: Replace `np.empty((0,), dtype=np.uint8)` with `np.array([], dtype=int).astype(np.uint8)`.

By making this change, the NumPy deprecation warnings should be resolved when running the code with an empty array of type `uint8`.
