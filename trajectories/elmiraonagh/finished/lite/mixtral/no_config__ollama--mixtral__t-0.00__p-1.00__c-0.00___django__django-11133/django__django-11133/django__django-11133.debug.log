I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory /django__django. Consider the following PR description:

<pr_description>
HttpResponse doesn't handle memoryview objects
Description
	
I am trying to write a BinaryField retrieved from the database into a HttpResponse. When the database is Sqlite this works correctly, but Postgresql returns the contents of the field as a memoryview object and it seems like current Django doesn't like this combination:
from django.http import HttpResponse																	 
# String content
response = HttpResponse("My Content")																			
response.content																								 
# Out: b'My Content'
# This is correct
# Bytes content
response = HttpResponse(b"My Content")																		 
response.content																								 
# Out: b'My Content'
# This is also correct
# memoryview content
response = HttpResponse(memoryview(b"My Content"))															 
response.content
# Out: b'<memory at 0x7fcc47ab2648>'
# This is not correct, I am expecting b'My Content'

</pr_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /django__django directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.

Here are the commands you have access to:
bash:
  docstring: runs the given command directly in bash
  signature: <command>
  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The bash command to execute.

str_replace_editor:
  docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`
Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]

  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
    - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.
    - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
    - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
    - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
    - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
    - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.

submit:
  docstring: submits the current file
  signature: submit



Write your thoughts out in plain text, then execute a SINGLE command surrounded in square brackets. Do NOT give more than one command while thinking. Just a single command at the end of your thoughts.

For example:

    It seems that the bug is blah blah blah.

    I need to look at file.py.

    [[[
    str_replace_editor view file.py
    ]]]

When you think you are done, use the submit command like this:

    [[[
    submit
    ]]]

Until then, use the commands listed above.
