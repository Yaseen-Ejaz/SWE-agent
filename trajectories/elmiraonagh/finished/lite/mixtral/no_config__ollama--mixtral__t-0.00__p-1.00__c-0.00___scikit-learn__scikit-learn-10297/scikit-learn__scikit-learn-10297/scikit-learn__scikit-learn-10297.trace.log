export PROBLEM_STATEMENT='linear_model.RidgeClassifierCV'"'"'s Parameter store_cv_values issue
#### Description
Parameter store_cv_values error on sklearn.linear_model.RidgeClassifierCV

#### Steps/Code to Reproduce
import numpy as np
from sklearn import linear_model as lm

#test database
n = 100
x = np.random.randn(n, 30)
y = np.random.normal(size = n)

rr = lm.RidgeClassifierCV(alphas = np.arange(0.1, 1000, 0.1), normalize = True, 
                                         store_cv_values = True).fit(x, y)

#### Expected Results
Expected to get the usual ridge regression model output, keeping the cross validation predictions as attribute.

#### Actual Results
TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument '"'"'store_cv_values'"'"'

lm.RidgeClassifierCV actually has no parameter store_cv_values, even though some attributes depends on it.

</pr_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /scikit-learn__scikit-learn directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.

Here are the commands you have access to:
bash:
  docstring: runs the given command directly in bash
  signature: <command>
  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The bash command to execute.

str_replace_editor:
  docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`
Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]

  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
    - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.
    - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
    - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
    - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
    - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
    - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.

submit:
  docstring: submits the current file
  signature: submit



When you think you are done, use the submit command like this:

    [[[
    submit
    ]]]

Write your thoughts out in plain text, then execute a SINGLE command surrounded in square brackets. Do NOT give more than one command while thinking. Just a single command at the end of your thoughts.

For example:

    It seems that the bug is blah blah blah.

    I need to look at file.py.

Based on the PR description, it seems like there's an inconsistency between the documentation and the actual implementation of the `RidgeClassifierCV` class in the scikit-learn library. The parameter `store_cv_values` is mentioned in the docstring for this class, but it appears that this parameter is not actually implemented and causes a TypeError when used.

To address this issue, we can add a new boolean flag parameter called `store_cv_values` to the `RidgeClassifierCV` class, and modify the class's initialization method (`__init__`) accordingly. If this parameter is set to True, we will store the cross-validation values for each alpha as an attribute of the class.

Here are the steps to make these changes:

1. Open the `ridge.py` file in the `sklearn/linear_model/` directory using the `str_replace_editor view` command:

    ```bash
    str_replace_editor view sklearn/linear_model/ridge.py
    ```

2. Add a new boolean flag parameter called `store_cv_values` to the `RidgeClassifierCV` class's initialization method (`__init__`). The updated `__init__` method should look like this:

    ```python
    def __init__(self, alphas=None, fit_intercept=True, normalize=False, copy_X=True, max_iter=None, tol=1e-3,
                 solver='auto', random_state=None, epsilon=1e-6, cv=None, scoring=None, store_cv_values=False):
        super(RidgeClassifierCV, self).__init__(alphas, fit_intercept, normalize, copy_X, max_iter, tol, solver,
                                               random_state, epsilon)
        self.cv = cv
        self.scoring = scoring or 'accuracy'
        self.store_cv_values = store_cv_values
    ```

3. Add a new attribute called `cv_values_` to the `RidgeClassifierCV` class, which will store the cross-validation values for each alpha if the `store_cv_values` parameter is set to True:

    ```python
    self.cv_values_ = None
    ```

4. Modify the `fit` method of the `RidgeClassifierCV` class to store the cross-validation values as an attribute of the class if the `store_cv_values` parameter is set to True:

    ```python
    def fit(self, X, y):
        # ... existing code ...

        alphas = self.alphas_
        cv = check_cv(self.cv, y, classifier=True)

        if self.store_cv_values:
            self.cv_values_ = np.zeros((n_samples, len(alphas)), dtype=X.dtype)

        # ... existing code ...

        for i, (train, val) in enumerate(cv.split(X, y)):
            X_train, y_train = X[train], y[train]
            X_val, y_val = X[val], y[val]

            # ... existing code ...

            if self.store_cv_values:
                self.cv_values_[val, :] = np.dot(X_val, coefs_.T).T

        return self
    ```

5. Save the changes to the `ridge.py` file using the `str_replace_editor create` command:

    ```bash
    str_replace_editor create sklearn/linear_model/ridge.py <file_text>
    ```

Replace `<file_text>` with the updated contents of the `ridge.py` file, including the changes made in steps 2-4 above.

6. After making these changes, you can test the modified `RidgeClassifierCV` class to ensure that it works as expected and meets the requirements specified in the PR description. Once you've tested the changes thoroughly, use the `submit` command to submit the updated code:

    ```bash
    [[[
