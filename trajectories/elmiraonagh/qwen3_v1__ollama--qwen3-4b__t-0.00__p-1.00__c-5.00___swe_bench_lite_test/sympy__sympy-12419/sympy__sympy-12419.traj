Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nSum of the elements of an identity matrix is zero\nI think this is a bug.\r\n\r\nI created a matrix by M.T * M under an assumption that M is orthogonal.  SymPy successfully recognized that the result is an identity matrix.  I tested its identity-ness by element-wise, queries, and sum of the diagonal elements and received expected results.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I attempt to evaluate the total sum of the elements the result was 0 while 'n' is expected.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy import Q as Query\r\n\r\nn = Symbol('n', integer=True, positive=True)\r\ni, j = symbols('i j', integer=True)\r\nM = MatrixSymbol('M', n, n)\r\n\r\ne = None\r\nwith assuming(Query.orthogonal(M)):\r\n    e = refine((M.T * M).doit())\r\n\r\n# Correct: M.T * M is an identity matrix.\r\nprint(e, e[0, 0], e[0, 1], e[1, 0], e[1, 1])\r\n\r\n# Correct: The output is True True\r\nprint(ask(Query.diagonal(e)), ask(Query.integer_elements(e)))\r\n\r\n# Correct: The sum of the diagonal elements is n\r\nprint(Sum(e[i, i], (i, 0, n-1)).doit())\r\n\r\n# So far so good\r\n# Total sum of the elements is expected to be 'n' but the answer is 0!\r\nprint(Sum(Sum(e[i, j], (i, 0, n-1)), (j, 0, n-1)).doit())\r\n```\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.",
